## Story: NPM Package Structure Validation

### Story ID

Story-0161

### Status

In review

### Description

Validate the structure and metadata of the NPM package.
- Ensure `package.json` fields (name, version, main, types, exports, dependencies) are correct.
- Verify `files` field or `.npmignore` correctly includes/excludes necessary files.
- Confirm TypeScript `.d.ts` files are correctly generated and consumable.
  **Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given a built package, when `npm pack` is run, then the generated `.tgz` contains only necessary files.
- Given a built package, when `package.json` is inspected, then all critical fields are correctly defined.
- Given a built package, when `.d.ts` files are checked, then they are present and valid.
  Tests:
  Unit:
  - N/A (mostly build/pack time checks)
    Integration:
  - Script to inspect `package.json` and `dist` contents post-build.
  - `dtslint` or similar tool to validate `.d.ts` files.
    E2E:
  - N/A
