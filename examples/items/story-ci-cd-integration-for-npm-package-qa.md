### Description

story id: Story 0165-CiNpmQa
description:
Integrate all NPM package quality assurance tests into the CI/CD pipeline.
- Configure CI to run package structure, installation, compatibility, and bundled product tests.
- Set these tests as mandatory gates before `npm publish`.
  **Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given a CI pipeline run, when all NPM package QA tests are executed, then they pass successfully.
- Given a failed NPM package QA test, when `npm publish` is attempted, then it is blocked.
  Tests:
  Unit:
  - N/A
    Integration:
  - CI configuration files (e.g., `.github/workflows/publish.yml`) are correctly set up.
    E2E:
  - Actual CI pipeline runs demonstrating successful and blocked publishing scenarios.
