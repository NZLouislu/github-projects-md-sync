### Description

story id: Story 0162-NpmInstall
description:
Verify the NPM package can be correctly installed and imported in various environments.
- Test installation using `npm`, `yarn`, and `pnpm`.
- Test installation in a clean Node.js environment (e.g., Docker).
- Ensure package entry points (`main`, `exports`) are resolvable after installation.
  **Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given a published/packed package, when `npm install` is run in a clean project, then it installs successfully.
- Given a published/packed package, when `yarn install` is run in a clean project, then it installs successfully.
- Given a published/packed package, when `pnpm install` is run in a clean project, then it installs successfully.
- Given an installed package, when its main export is imported, then it loads without error.
  Tests:
  Unit:
  - N/A
    Integration:
  - Script to create temporary project, install package, and attempt import.
    E2E:
  - Docker-based test running installation and basic usage in isolated environments.
